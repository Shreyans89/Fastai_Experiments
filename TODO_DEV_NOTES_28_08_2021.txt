IDEAS:

1. IMPLEMENT LOGGING IN FASTAI LEARNER
SAVE metadata,model,metrics,run_PARAMS for each run

2. VIDEO LEARNING
IS THE SAME as language models with ENCODERS as CNNS
from each scene learn a WORD embedding then do RNN/
LSTMS

3. VIDEO CLASSIFICATION:
AS the base case,extract frames along the time axis
label each frame, now you have reduced the problem to
IMAGE CLASSIFICATION,with labels and items neatly aligned
along the time axis 


STEVE BRUNTON :DMD (Dynamic Mode Decomp) : learn a coordinate trans
form (function) to downsample fulls space to latent subspace

xi=phi(yi)
i in [0:T]

learn dynamics of latent space,x such that dynamics are easy/
linear/in a subspace of functions :

x[t+1]=F(x[t])

then decode the latent space xi to reconstruct yi

yi=psi(xi) : because the mapping is approximate(there is recon
struction loss), psi != phi^-1 (phi inverse)

this general approach uses an encoder/decoder network psi and
phi to encode to and decode from latent space x ,also a recurr
ant network f()  which is the dynamics of the lower dimensional
space x.

Some general examples of this approach:


simple diagnalization of the dynamics matrix to solve a linear
system of ODES can be thought of as an encoder T^-1exp(lambda)T
T^-1 :inverse eigenvector matrix -encoder
T  :  eigenvector matrix -decoder
x *= lambda(x) there lambda is matrix with eigenvals on
diag is the latent space x where dynamics are simpler

SVD of time series matrix- U sigma V^t (V transpose)
U encoder sigmma- (simgular values-dynamics) V transpose-decoder

Artificial creation of data to benchmark pizel level 
classification/segmentation architectures: generate shapes with 
increasing level of complexity with parameters drawn from sample
distributions. (think radii of circles, e of ellipse/dims of
rectangle etc.). attempt to segragate the data based on the 
distribution from which it was drawn (at a pixel level)

Additionally: add noise/jitter to regular shapes (rectangle etc)
to get slightly non uniform shapes tgis will approximate cellular
detection under variation of samples
